					<h1>CONTENT: notes on this 3col fixed assignment</h1>
					<p>As in the 2 column exercise, the color change is detectabale where
					   the div meets the .jpg background. I used the same hexidecimal number
					   in the PS doc as was used in the HTML?</p>
					<p>The exercise uses a main wrapper background image as one fixed strip.
					   I get serious Float Drop when I resize (reduce) the browser window. I
					   think that is what "display:inline;/* stops IE doubling margin on float"
					   is for, but would like further explanation to understand this comment.</p>
					<p>Is keeping the #wrapper div necessary in a stylesheet if there is also 
					   going to be separate version wrappers as we have here to contain the
					   different background images? Or perhaps this is an example of an inner
					   div as the book suggests? I am still confused of that detail. </p>
					<p>Even though I have auto margin sets on the wrapper div, the page still
					   hugs the left side? I have tried it in all of them, but it won't budge? </p>
					<p>Obviously, this footer has a mind of it's own... It is in the wrapper,
					   but the "clear" seems to be allowing it outside. However, when i remove
					   the "clear", it hugs the bottom of the header? </p>
